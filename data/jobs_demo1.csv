Position Overview

Bernstein Private Wealth Management is a premier investment management firm advising high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients. As an industry leader, we put people first and pride ourselves on selecting and developing high caliber talent.

Bernstein Private Wealth Associates are client service professionals who exhibit drive, ambition, and exceptional communication and relationship-building skills, and who, in collaboration with Financial Advisors, help propel the growth of our Private Wealth Management Platform. This is an exciting and challenging opportunity to partner with Advisors to provide asset allocation recommendations, capital markets positioning, portfolio analytics, and wealth and legacy planning for high-net-worth individuals and families.







Associates will participate in a robust and comprehensive training program – The Associate Development Program (ADP). After years of heavy financial investment and input from industry leaders, ADP is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. The Program is designed to build a foundation of investment knowledge and develop the quantitative and qualitative skills needed to achieve long-term stability and success, regardless of your incoming background.





Associates have a myriad of opportunities to continue their career with us as a client service professional or in areas including Leadership, Wealth Strategies, Investment Strategies, and building their own business as an Advisor. We take all of our Associates' development seriously, and we focus on understanding each individual’s strengths and aspirations, personalizing a roadmap with the success of each team member in mind. As Associates progress in the role, and as milestones are achieved and core competencies are exhibited (typically over the course of ~3 years), we celebrate the opportunity to advance team members on to other exciting opportunities at Bernstein Private Wealth Management.













Bernstein Private Wealth Management advises high-net-worth clients on planning for—and living with—the complexities that come with wealth. We specialize in addressing challenges that extend well beyond wealth management by offering a vast network of resources customized to clients’ values and needs.

Bernstein is distinguished among major wealth managers by its holistic approach, flexible process, innovative research, sophisticated modeling, and cutting-edge investment solutions. Our people are our advantage. Our collaborative culture means each client is supported by a team of specialists aligned with a shared sense of purpose.

Bernstein is a business unit of AllianceBernstein, which ranks among the largest investment managers in the world, with 4,400 employees across 51 locations in 25 countries and over $700 billion in assets under management.
