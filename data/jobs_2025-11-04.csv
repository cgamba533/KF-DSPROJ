Who You'll Work With

Bernstein's Wealth Strategies team is a multi-disciplinary group of professionals with expertise helping individuals and families navigate complex wealth planning. Our mandate is to provide actionable advice for clients as it relates to planning for lifetime spending, wealth transfer, philanthropy, and the investment implementation of these plans. We focus first on uncovering client priorities, values, and defining goals. We next help our clients achieve these goals by crafting a research based financial plan consistent with their priorities and values.



We seek an insurance professional with well-rounded expertise in personal insurance planning for high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and their families, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care, health, disability, and property/casualty insurance. The individual will be based in one of our US offices and report to the Head of Bernstein's Wealth Strategies Group. The Director of Insurance Planning is a client-facing sales support role working alongside Bernstein’s Wealth Advisors to expand the Private Wealth business. As a key domain expert supporting Bernstein's wealth planning research, the Director will frequently be called upon to provide thought leadership on insurance-related issues to clients, in audiences large and small, through individualized & group presentations, case studies, articles, and, potentially, external media.

A strong background in risk management and insurance planning is required, including experience in and knowledge of life insurance and annuity products, long-term care insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, and property/casualty insurance products. Specifically, the candidate must have experience and expertise in analyzing client insurance needs, evaluating insurance and annuity products, evaluating tax-efficient structuring and conducting financial planning.

The Director of Insurance Planning – working in conjunction with Bernstein's Investment and Wealth Strategies Analysts and Senior Planning and Investment Professionals – will help develop customized solutions for the firm's clients. Because this position is client-facing, the individual must have outstanding presentation skills and the ability to explain complex issues and strategies to both technical and non-technical audiences.







Strong analytical skills, thought leadership, an effective interpersonal style, excellent public-speaking skills, a strong academic record and a history of professional success are also required. Strong mathematical skills, including familiarity with basic estate planning analytical software and Excel, are preferred.

Having the highest level of personal and professional integrity is essential. To succeed at the firm, the individual must be very bright, quantitative, intellectually sophisticated, client-service oriented, and able to work in a team-based culture; building strong relationships both inside and outside the firm will be essential. The position will require some travel.

FINRA registration (SIE, Series 7 and Series 66 or equivalent) and Insurance Licenses (Life, Variable and/or Property/Casualty) are required for this role. Bernstein will sponsor for FINRA licensing.

At Brown Advisory, we aim to be one of those inspired firms. Over the years, we have purposefully built and nurtured our client-first culture.

Being in a customer support role, you will have the opportunity to identify the technology needs of your colleagues and provide feedback to your management and the technology team. You will be proactive in resolving issues and find ways to enhance efficiency and quality of service to our colleagues.



Customer-oriented - You will need to be able to deliver a high level of customer support and training to colleagues at all levels of the company and explain and resolve complex technical issues to a non-technical audience. You possess excellent customer service and interpersonal skills. In this role, you are the face of the Technology Team and the first person to help with a technology issue.

A self-starter - You are quick to respond to operational tasks and can find opportunities for process improvement and work with the Help Desk and greater Technology Team to achieve these goals. You possess the time management skills to prioritize your tasks.

A natural problem solver - You identify challenges, analyze the root causes, seek to understand rationale behind current setups, and offer changes to improve where needed.

Able to take ownership of tasks and see them to their resolution - When gaps in processes or a lack of accountability are identified, you take ownership and ensure that these needs are met.

Comfortable with a wide array of technology – We are responsible for supporting many technology systems and provide comprehensive support to employees that require support.

A team player – You will be working with teammates and supporting colleagues in multiple office locations. Being based in our Baltimore Office, you will be part of a local technology team and responsible for providing effective technology support to the Baltimore Office colleagues. Occasional travel to our other offices will be required. You will also work with the greater technology team and will need to be able to consider differing office cultures and communication styles.
