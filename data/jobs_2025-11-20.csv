Who You'll Work With

Bernstein's Wealth Strategies team is a multi-disciplinary group of professionals with expertise helping individuals and families navigate complex wealth planning. Our mandate is to provide actionable advice for clients as it relates to planning for lifetime spending, wealth transfer, philanthropy, and the investment implementation of these plans. We focus first on uncovering client priorities, values, and defining goals. We next help our clients achieve these goals by crafting a research based financial plan consistent with their priorities and values.



We seek an insurance professional with well-rounded expertise in personal insurance planning for high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and their families, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care, health, disability, and property/casualty insurance. The individual will be based in one of our US offices and report to the Head of Bernstein's Wealth Strategies Group. The Director of Insurance Planning is a client-facing sales support role working alongside Bernstein’s Wealth Advisors to expand the Private Wealth business. As a key domain expert supporting Bernstein's wealth planning research, the Director will frequently be called upon to provide thought leadership on insurance-related issues to clients, in audiences large and small, through individualized & group presentations, case studies, articles, and, potentially, external media.

A strong background in risk management and insurance planning is required, including experience in and knowledge of life insurance and annuity products, long-term care insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, and property/casualty insurance products. Specifically, the candidate must have experience and expertise in analyzing client insurance needs, evaluating insurance and annuity products, evaluating tax-efficient structuring and conducting financial planning.

The Director of Insurance Planning – working in conjunction with Bernstein's Investment and Wealth Strategies Analysts and Senior Planning and Investment Professionals – will help develop customized solutions for the firm's clients. Because this position is client-facing, the individual must have outstanding presentation skills and the ability to explain complex issues and strategies to both technical and non-technical audiences.







Strong analytical skills, thought leadership, an effective interpersonal style, excellent public-speaking skills, a strong academic record and a history of professional success are also required. Strong mathematical skills, including familiarity with basic estate planning analytical software and Excel, are preferred.

Having the highest level of personal and professional integrity is essential. To succeed at the firm, the individual must be very bright, quantitative, intellectually sophisticated, client-service oriented, and able to work in a team-based culture; building strong relationships both inside and outside the firm will be essential. The position will require some travel.

FINRA registration (SIE, Series 7 and Series 66 or equivalent) and Insurance Licenses (Life, Variable and/or Property/Casualty) are required for this role. Bernstein will sponsor for FINRA licensing.

Job Description

The Private Client experience at J.P. Morgan offers a pathway to Wealth Management through comprehensive, expert planning. The Private Wealth Planner (PWP) role is central to this, working collaboratively with an integrated client service team to provide clients with a detailed financial plan. Utilizing J.P. Morgan’s proprietary Wealth Plan software, the PWP guides clients through a discovery process, providing a report that focuses on achieving their goals and the asset allocation needed. This holistic planning is a primary benefit of being a J.P. Morgan Private Client, marking the initial engagement of bank-only clients with Wealth Management.

As a Vice President, Private Wealth Planner within J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, you will engage with clients and prospective clients who express interest in having a financial plan. You will work collaboratively with an integrated client service team to provide comprehensive financial planning services. Your role will involve using J.P. Morgan’s proprietary Wealth Plan software to provide reports that help clients focus on successfully meeting their goals. You will also educate the integrated team about the value Wealth Planning can bring to a relationship and work with them to develop business opportunities with new and existing clients. This role requires travel among branches and offices as needed.

The successful candidate will have knowledge of and experience in delivering all aspects of financial planning, including asset and liability management, asset allocation, diversification, basic trusts & estates, basic individual tax rules (both transfer and income taxes), insurance, long-term care, philanthropy, college savings, retirement, and cash flow planning. Knowledge of issues relating to securities-based compensation (restricted stock, employee stock options, performance share units, etc.), pre-liquidity planning, and concentrated position management (such as 10b5-1 plans, derivative-based transactions, and exchange funds) is a plus but is not necessary for the role.

To be successful in this role the individual must be able to communicate planning concepts in a simple, non-technical way and must be comfortable working with individuals and families ranging from affluent to high- and ultra-high net worth. The successful individual should approach clients with a goal-oriented approach; to that end, the individual will need to learn about the various products and platforms (investment, insurance, charitable, educational) available to Private Client Advisors in order to help identify issues and opportunities to engage with clients.

The candidate will cover a region within Private Client, which will include at least one preferred branch as well as at least one office.

Position Overview

An indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Management Holdings, AASP manages the securitized products and structured finance assets sourced and serviced by ATLAS SP Partners while serving as their sole risk manager.

The Role

As the Risk Management Director, you will be the lead risk manager on ATLAS Aircraft and the broader Transportation (Rail, Shipping, Container, etc.) lending and capital markets portfolio across the NY time zone.

With respect to Aircraft, this role involves bespoke underwrites, including older aircraft, green time engines, part-out structures, back-leverage for sponsor portfolio, etc. This person needs to have the ability to be hands-on, a willingness to work on deals directly, and to go through a training process/learning curve on ATLAS-specific aircraft structures. The portfolio will require increased monitoring and oversight (e.g., specifically for asset classes not tested through the cycle, asset classes that do not yet have a proven securitization market, and asset classes under stress).

You will work closely with the ATLAS Origination teams, other risk leaders, and clients to evaluate credit risk in new and existing transactions. Their analysis and independent views will be heavily relied upon by the AASP CRO and Apollo senior risk officers to gain comfort in signing off on transactions. You will develop a strong partnership with deal teams to ensure alignment between the business and the firm’s acknowledged risk appetite. You will also be responsible for enhancing the stature of the credit risk team through a stronger culture of review and challenge.

As the Risk Management Director, you will manage multiple projects simultaneously with appropriate analytical support, and your asset class coverage will evolve depending on the deal volume.

This role requires deep subject matter expertise, specifically in analyzing the assets and structural protections, sponsor and/or originator financial wherewithal, and servicer capabilities. The Director should have the ability to manage challenging collateral, valuation, and security interest/enforcement provisions.

Ability and willingness to learn about other transportation assets and asset types over time is a must.

The ideal candidate will have a genuine interest in securitized products and warehouse lending and have significant experience working within the aircraft and/or broader transportation sector, strong written, verbal, and presentation skills.

Being in a customer support role, you will have the opportunity to identify the technology needs of your colleagues and provide feedback to your management and the technology team. You will be proactive in resolving issues and find ways to enhance efficiency and quality of service to our colleagues.

A natural problem solver - You identify challenges, analyze the root causes, seek to understand rationale behind current setups, and offer changes to improve where needed.

Able to take ownership of tasks and see them to their resolution - When gaps in processes or a lack of accountability are identified, you take ownership and ensure that these needs are met.

Comfortable with a wide array of technology – We are responsible for supporting many technology systems and provide comprehensive support to employees that require support.

A team player – You will be working with teammates and supporting colleagues in multiple office locations.
